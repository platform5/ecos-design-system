  <h1>Understanding the Ecos project</h1>
  <p>The main goal of this project (at the moment) is to experiment FAST and try to build things with it.</p>

  <h2>What kind of experiment ?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Experimenting <strong>extending the FAST Frame</strong> design system. If this works well it should enable the project to provide a Design System of its own.</li>
    <li>Experimenting how components work together when used in <strong>common use cases.</strong> The idea is to put together a homepage, a doc page, a blog page and an admin dashboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Playing with design tokens on the fly</strong> and see how they affect the overall result.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How is the project organized ?</h2>

  <h3>The design system</h3>
  <p>The main piece of the project is the design system itself. It is found in the <code>/src/ecos-design-system</code> folder. This folder can be extracted and published on its own.</p>

  <au-snippet class="mobile-full-bleed">
    <div language="shell">
      # The following command builds the ecos-design-system as a standalone module ready to be published on NPM
      npm run build
    </div>
  </au-snippet>

  <h3>The testing app</h3>
  <p>In order to play with the design system there is an Aurelia 2 application in the <code>/src</code> folder.</p>

  <au-snippet class="mobile-full-bleed">
    <div language="shell">
      # The following command starts the app on localhost:9000
      npm run start

      # The following command builds the app
      npm run build-app
    </div>
  </au-snippet>

  <au-snippet class="mobile-full-bleed">
    <div language="shell">
      # This folder contains app-specific components. Either ECOS components or AU2 custom elements;
      /src/custom-elements

      # Codebase for the whole design system experiment
      /src/ecos-design-system

      # This folder contains the routes modules loaded by the AU2 app
      /src/routes

      # Some app-specific CSS files
      /src/*.css

      # ecos-app.* are the main application files
      /src/*.css

      # Entry point for the AU2 application
      /src/main.ts
    </div>
  </au-snippet>
